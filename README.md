# PostsApp

This is only code. Live version: http://potemaki.s3-website.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com


App connets through NodeJS using Express to database - MongoDB, where it stores all users and posts,
We create account to fully use website, backend sever encrypt password using bcrypt, to make it safe,
We can add post with picture, we can later edit that post (if we are creator) and change or delet that picture,
Small details: we can like post and then see people who liked it by hovering on it, we can check other users and their profile by navigating sidebar
We can edit our account: change nickname, password or profile picture.

App uses AWE hosting service as github doesnt support backend hosting.
